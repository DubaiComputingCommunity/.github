The **Dubai Computing Community** is a dubai-based, student-led initiative with the intent of bringing aspiring Computer Scientists together. 

We launched this initiative because we felt that, although Dubai is an amazing place, there are a few gaps. One such gap is the Computer Science community - there's some serious potential from students across the city to do ground-breaking things. The only problem is they're not being given the right resources to really take it to the next level. We want to change that. We want to create a place teeming with the exchange of ideas, a dense support network, and overall positive vibes! Join our discord [here](https://discord.gg/DmMNJdTBGC)!
